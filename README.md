Abstract: This study explores the dissociation of oscillatory dynamics between symbolic (algebraic) and non-symbolic (geometric) processing in advanced mathematical reasoning. Modern mathematics education prioritizes symbolic rigor, prompting ongoing debates on the balance between symbolic and non-symbolic reasoning.
Employing mobile EEG technology, we investigated students’ beta and gamma wave patterns as they engaged with mathematical demonstrations in both symbolic and non-symbolic formats within a tutor-student framework. We aimed to create authentic educational experiences using extended, naturalistic stimuli.
We found nuanced distinctions in neural processing, particularly during the 100-200 ms post-stimulus onset window. Behaviorally, students rated symbolic demonstrations higher for understanding and familiarity. Despite that, no clear format preference emerged. This research advances cognitive neuroscience and identifies potentially actionable insights for educators, facilitating the synthesis of formal mathematical symbolism and intuitive mathematical reasoning.
